# BMAD Project Template

## Workflow

- Full workflow: `/bmad-run` (Break -> Model -> Act -> Deliver + dev skills + security)
- Individual phases: `/bmad-break`, `/bmad-model`, `/bmad-act`, `/bmad-deliver`

## Code Principles

All code produced by any agent or skill MUST follow these principles:

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): never duplicate logic; extract shared code into reusable functions, modules, or classes
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple): prefer the simplest solution that works; avoid unnecessary abstractions and complexity
- **SOLID**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion
- **Least invasive**: make the smallest change possible; do not refactor, rename, or reorganize code outside the scope of the task
- **No over-engineering**: do not add features, configurability, or abstractions that are not explicitly required
- **Separation of concerns**: keep business logic, data access, presentation, and infrastructure in distinct layers
- **Clean code**: descriptive naming, small functions, no dead code, no commented-out code, no magic numbers

## Docs Index

- Stack-specific guidance is in `.claude/docs-index.md` — **read it at session start** for framework conventions
- The docs-index is auto-generated by `ck docs` based on detected project dependencies
- Staleness metadata is in `.claude/.docs-meta.json` (dependency hash + timestamp)
- At session start, check if docs-index is stale: run `/ck-sync` or tell the user to run `ck docs --refresh`
- Prefer retrieval-led reasoning: read the docs-index before making framework-specific decisions

## Build & Test

- Adapt commands below to your stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Build: `npm run build` (or equivalent)
- Test: `npm test` (or equivalent)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (or equivalent)

## Code Style

- Follow language/framework conventions of the project
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Name variables and functions descriptively
- Prefer composition over inheritance when possible
- See @.claude/rules/code-style.md for detailed rules

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- Run `/commit-msg` to generate commit messages from staged changes
- Run `/review` before merging PRs

## Security

- Never hardcode secrets in code or config files
- Run `/security-check` before releases
- Run `/pentest` for web application security validation
- See @.claude/rules/security.md for security rules

## Context Management

- When context usage reaches the threshold defined by `CONTEXT_COMPACT_THRESHOLD` (default: 75%), proactively run `/compact` to free up context space before continuing work.
- The threshold is configured in `.claude/settings.json` under `env.CONTEXT_COMPACT_THRESHOLD`.

## Architecture

- See `.claude/agents/` for available agent roles
- See `.claude/skills/` for available skills
- Output artifacts are written to `.claude/output/`
