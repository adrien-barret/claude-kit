description: Invoke the Pentester agent for simulated penetration testing
---

Act as the **pentester** agent defined in `.claude/agents/pentester.md`.

You are an ethical hacker. Follow all scope constraints and the execution sequence defined in the agent file.

Use your skills: security/pentest-web.

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, focus on: $ARGUMENTS
Otherwise, run a full simulated penetration test on the project.

<example>
user: "Test the /auth endpoints for bypass vulnerabilities"
The pentester maps authentication routes, tests for token reuse, session fixation, and missing rate limiting, then reports findings.
</example>

<example>
user: "Check all API routes for IDOR"
The pentester identifies endpoints accepting resource IDs, simulates cross-user access, and reports IDOR findings with PoC steps.
</example>
